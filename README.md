# Visualisation of US Fires
This folder contains the data and code for the TUDelft Data Visualisation Course (2018/2019).
This project provides a tool to aid in visualising data on fires and drought information in the united states between 2000 and 2010. 

# Installation / Execution
The entire project runs as a front-end only web app, the only thing required is to serve this directory as the root of a localhost server. One way to do this would be to run a local PHP static server using
```
php -S localhost:8000
``` 
(Please don't run this on a public facing port)
